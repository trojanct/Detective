I chose Michael It all made sense looking at the facts I went in and confronted him. The Broken trophy was a ruse he never liked Louie living there and he used the item that represented that. The Burner phone was too his and him and his secretary were having an affair. it was obvious Ella put up a huge fight against the suspect and it was clear that it was someone that she knew deeply. As the sounds of their fight got louder Ella was about to call the cops when she was struck from behind by a trophy that were around the house. Simmons secretary which turns out to be his mistress and the messages where to him. Simmons tried to deny all the acquisitions thrown towards him, but I detective Raad threw at him that he has a witness who saw him the night of the murder. Also, in order to trick Simmons into confession told him his mistress was questioned earlier today and pined everything on Simmons when offered a deal from the DA. Simmons went crazy and confessed to the murder. He confessed that his wife was going to file for divorce and was going to take everything from him. He confessed that his mistress convinced him that, that was the only way.  He screamed and said, "All my hard work she was going to take so she deserved to die. I hated her. My life was miserable."  Simmons was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced life in prison, while his mistress was sentenced to 6 years in prison for accessory to crime. When the court day arrived, I was stunned to see Claire without makeup being the same woman at the scene of the crime how were we that blind. Well another case closed and two less friends to take on this crazy world.
