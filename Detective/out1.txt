After searching the house, I go back outside to interview possible suspects. There is a "woman" that looks to be quite "nosey" and pompous, an overzealous "paparazzi", a "homeless man", a very "excited" looking "woman", and an "angry" looking "man". The police are all over the place trying to maintain the crowds and look rather thinned out at the moment. The Sergeant looks like he's busy with the actual press so no getting info out of either of them. Michael has already been escorted to the police station.
