I chose Louie. He had all the motives as he was getting kicked out. The evidence in the house showed he had a rough relationship with his sister. The phone was outdated, belonging to someone who can't afford something pricey. The apartment was in walking distance, and when questioned who owned the place, said that Michael payed for it. When questioned, Michael said it was Louie's, but he just wouldn't move out completely. The struggle showed it was someone Ella knew and with Louie keeping in shape even after his injuries he could have overpowered her. With that, Louie was arrested and sentenced to life in prison for first-degree murder. After the trial me and Michael had some supper at my place, catching up and talking about the good times. He then got up to get some wine he brought from his car. I was so happy it was over, I didn't notice the bottle coming down on my head.
