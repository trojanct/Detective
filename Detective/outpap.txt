I approach the paparazzo. He's rather annoyed I’m 'in his shot'. I ask him if he happened to hear anything of importance, he thought he heard the nearby homeless man mumble something about seeing someone but shrugged it off as him being crazy. I'm suddenly blinded by the paparazzo's camera flash; he took several pictures of me suddenly. He then proceeds to shoo me off so he can get more shots, without me in the middle of them.
