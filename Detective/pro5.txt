As I went Outside to get some air, not wanting to talk to the media, I see him, Michael. He just got through the crowd and is being stopped by the police. I rushed forwards as I needed to tell Michael what happened. Michael worriedly asks: Where is she? Is she okay? Why is there police everywhere, Rad? I reply: Im sorry Michael... but she's dead. After I told him, Michael audibly broke down and asked the same questions as before. I need to find who did this one way or another.
