I went in to talk to Michael as he just got done telling his story. I give him my condolences. We make small talk and then I get into it. Michael's story is that he was with his secretary during the night of the murder. They had a long day planning a business trip for Hawaii for a company conference. They were working late because the budget didn't add up and they needed to make sure everything was up to date. When he got the call, he dropped what he was doing and made the hour-long trip to get to his house. When police questioned the secretary, Claire, everything she said corroborated with his story.
