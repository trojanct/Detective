The playboxswitch I remember playing this in college looking through the game boxes for anything I didn’t find anything out of the ordinary just the latest games then I came upon an older title. It had a cracked spine and when I looked inside, I found a note. “Keep this as long as you like -Raad.” This was the game I lent Michael what is this doing here we’ll I’m taking this back but how did it get here.
