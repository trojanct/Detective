Digging through the waste basket I find a plethora of tissues simply damp with mild cleaning on all. While going deeper I found something quite strange a cellphone with buttons. This isn’t something to just throw away. From the look of it is new but with an older design it screams cheap. I try to turn it on, but it is missing its "sim card". I’ll put it in my inventory anyway.
