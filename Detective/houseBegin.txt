When I get back inside the forensics are now in her office where the body is. With looking over the body and seeing Michael I can now do a deep search. When I search, I can cover entire rooms and just get the facts I need.I can also "talk" to harrison for a clue. It's a relatively nice, and decent size house and decently clean as well. Should I "search" the study? The kitchen? The brothers-bedroom? Or the master-bedroom?
