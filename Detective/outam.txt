I approach the angry man. I ask him if he saw anything relating to the case. He instead goes off on a very long tangent about how loud his neighbors were being. I tell him that the apartment he heard all the noise from had a murdered woman in it and that he must've heard the murder happen last night. A shocked and saddened expression comes across his face. He liked the woman and enjoyed talking to her at the mailbox. He new her personally I asked if how she was last time, he saw her. He told me about a conversation last week mostly pleasantries but did say she was worried about her husband’s business trips costing them money.
