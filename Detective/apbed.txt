Checking the bed, its quite simple with a simple mattress on the floor with a few covers. Looking underneath however, shows a cavalcade of items including a pile of receipts all of which are for clothes, jewelry, and electronics. None of which has been seen at the apartment. Also, a small pile of money. Looking at the pile, there must be about 2 grand here. In the mess of money and receipts is a "sim card" as well as some "batteries".
