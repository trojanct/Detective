I went to talk to the brother. His name is Louie. He was young man with a promising sports career before his knee injury. After that, he has been going from job to job and has been slumming it at his sister's place for about 6 months. I asked him his alibi, he says he was looking through apartments on foot all afternoon. When he got home there were cops everywhere and the police arrested him on the spot. When I asked him about the boxes, he told me that his sister and her husband were having some financial troubles and couldn't let him stay anymore. The final straw was when he got in an argument about Michael not wanting his trophies all over the home like he owns the place. His alibi of looking for apartments was investigated but the last landlord he spoke to was 2 hours before the murder took place and he was in walking distance of home.
