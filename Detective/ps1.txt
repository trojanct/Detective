It was a cold Thursday morning when I went to the Police Station. Not feeling well because today I give my evidence and put the man who killed my former sweetheart. When I get there, the sergeant asks me where I have been that they already caught the guy. It was the victim's brother who lived in the same house but was moving out. There were some financial issues on the Simmons end so they could not keep him. Michael was also here telling his story and giving his account of the night. Well I have some options now. I could talk to Michael and get his story, talk to the brother to get his side, look over the evidence, or choose who did it.
