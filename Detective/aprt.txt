As I came to the apartment, I was a bit skeptical if this key would even work, but then I came to the apartment number. With a 'click', the door unlocked. I hope that the key and what the homeless man said is worth looking into. I went into the apartment that seems like something someone would have right out of college, but much cleaner. Many expensive electronics, a big television, posters from 80’s rock bands, and a "couch" in front of it. The kitchen and the living area connected with two doors, one leading to a room with only a "bed" with a mattress on the floor, and the other locked. Presumably the restroom, but why would it be locked? There is a "table" in the kitchen covered with mail, and the television "stand" is packed with junk. This might be breaking and entering, but it’s my only lead. I should start looking around for clues.
