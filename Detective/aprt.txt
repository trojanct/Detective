As I came to the apartment, I was a bit skeptical if this key would even work but then I came to the number a 'click' the door unlocked. Here is hoping that the key and what the homeless man said is worth looking into. I went into an apartment that seems like something someone would have right out of college but much cleaner. Many expensive electronics, a big television, posters from 80’s rock bands, and a "couch" in front of it. The kitchen and the living area connected with two doors one leading to a room with only a "bed" with a mattress on the floor and the other locked presumably the restroom but why would it be locked. There is a "table" in the kitchen filled with mail and the television "stand" is packed with junk. This might be breaking and entering but it’s my only lead. I should start looking around for clues.
