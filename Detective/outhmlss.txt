I approach the homeless man. He looks a little frazzled, like he saw something pertaining to the crime possibly. I ask him If he saw anything, and he said in the night, he saw a man run off from the apartment, but it was too dark and he was covered from head to toe in dark clothing that he couldn't make out any distinguishing features. The way the man ran was in the direction of the apartment that I found the key to at the crime scene.
