Putting the Sim card into the phone gave me quite a shock. Several messages came in at once. Looking at the phone, only the background showing a young woman and 3 text messages on the phone were visible. They state "Is it done? Remember to text me when it's done so we can discuss what we're going to do next my huggy wuggy bear." Next text stated: "Why haven’t you texted back? Is it done or not? Remember it is over if you can’t decide and this will show me you truly love me." Last text: "I saw you on the news. I'm going to make sure it was done." This is quite strange, what could this mean? Am I holding the phone of the killer? I need to go to the station. I think I have an idea who did this.
