With the key, I open the bathroom door and inside I find a decently cleaned and a fresh scent. The bathroom has quite a selection of shampoos, conditioners, and some nice peach smelling soap. All of which have been used recently. Also, an almost empty bottle of Allcleaner by the tub. In the corner, I find a rather full "waste basket" with several clumps of wetted tissues on top. In the side of the bath there is a very damp "towel" as well.
