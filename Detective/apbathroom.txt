With the key I open the bathroom door and inside I find a decently cleaned and a fresh scent. bathroom with quite a selection of shampoos, and conditioners, and some nice peach smelling soap all of which have been used recently. Also, a bottle of Allcleaner by the tub almost empty. In the corner I find a rather full "waste basket" with several clumps of wetted tissues on top. In the side of the bath there is a very damp "towel" as well.
